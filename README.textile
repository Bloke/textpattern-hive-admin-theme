*NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN ONCE THEME REDESIGN IS COMPLETE*

Also within the @custom.css@ file, there are options to hide certain sections/fields from displaying in the admin pages. To use any of the options uncomment their lines (remove the @/*@ and @*/@ from the line of CSS you want to activate).

For example, to completely hide the keywords field from your admin-side, find this line in the @custom.css@ file:

bc. /* #write-comments{display:none !important;} */

and change to:

bc. #write-comments{display:none !important;}

h3. One last thing...

In this theme, the 3 preview tabs on article write/article edit forms have been removed to save screen estate. They were arguable pretty useless anyway so they were dropped, we have never used them in all our time with Textpattern. If you really do want to enable these tabs again then comment out the following line ~??? of the theme's @textpattern.css@ file (you'll have to add some custom styling to them though):

bc. #article-tabs{display:none;}
