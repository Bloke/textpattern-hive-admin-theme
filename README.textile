Hive admin-side theme for Textpattern CMS v4.6 - built with Sass and Compass. *Currently under development.*

h2. Requirements

Building this repository requires:

* "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/ >=0.8.0
* "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
* "Bundler":http://bundler.io/
* "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ ~0.4.0

h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/, "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/, "Bundler":http://bundler.io/ and "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/. You can install Node and Ruby using their installers, Bundler with gem and the Grunt with npm:

bc. $ gem install bundler
$ npm install -g grunt-cli

Consult the tools' documentation for more instructions.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd txp-hive-admin-theme
$ npm install
$ bundle install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt and *bundle* takes care of Ruby gems.

h2. Building

This repository hosts sources and needs to be built before it can be used. After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, including building:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is either @test@, @build@ or @watch@. Watch will launch a task that watches for file changes. The project is automatically built if a source file is modified. The build task builds the project.
