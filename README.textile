h2. Usage instructions

*NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN ONCE THEME REDESIGN IS COMPLETE*

Within the @custom.css@ file, there are options to hide certain sections/fields from displaying in the admin pages. To use any of the options just uncomment their lines (remove the @/*@ and @*/@ from the line of CSS you want to activate).

For example, to completely hide the keywords field from your admin-side, find this line in the @custom.css@ file:

bc. /* #write-comments {display:none !important;} */

and change to:

bc. #write-comments {display:none !important;}
